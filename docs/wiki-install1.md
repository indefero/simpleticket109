### Procedure setup screen ###

**Pre-setup installation data**: osTicket's installation script will attempt to auto-detect paths and any permission issues. 

* If the script spots any configuration errors then it will not allow you to continue until the errors are corrected.
* If everything checks out, **you will be presented with a form to fill in the required information**.

Please **fill** the user admin login, names, info, **database user, name and address, and very important, emails of admin and system.**

* Fill database username and password, also the database name
* Email user admin and email for send or system mail must be different, Email will work only with php-mail module enabled.
* If any errors occurs, go back and check the data entered.
* On valid data the script will create and populate the database plus write a configuration file.
