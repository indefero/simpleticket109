## PRocedure install ##

Lest assume the following environment:
1. a local install, so all will be **refered into the** `127.0.0.1` **address ip** machine.
2. has access to a terminal program with **console and a root/administrator access/password** to type commands.
3. has access to a **MySQL/MariaDB database with a username** and their respective password.

The easy and simples way its **put all the files in root web server**, by example if root web server are `/var/www/html` 
then put the complete osticket files inside a new directory as `/var/www/html/simpleticket/` then..

osTicket installer requires ability to write to the configuration file, `include/ost-config.php` so then 
before start to install, copy by the following command assuming the previous environment described in first paragraph:

`cp /var/www/html/simpleticket/include/ost-sampleconfig.php /var/www/html/simpleticket/ost-config.php`

but now must be sure permission are correct, so change owner to the user that runs the software of webserver, 
by example, in mayor linux distros are `www-data` or `httpd` in BSD-like/OsX so the next command wil be:

`chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/simpleticket/`

**once done, open a browser and call `http://127.0.0.1/simpleticket`** the setup program will redirect 
to proper screen to install.

**Pre-setup installation data**: osTicket's installation script will attempt to auto-detect paths and any permission issues. 

* If the script spots any configuration errors then it will not allow you to continue until the errors are corrected.
* If everything checks out, **you will be presented with a form to fill in the required information**.

Please **fill** the user admin login, names, info, **database user, name and address, and very important, emails of admin and system.**

* Fill database username and password, also the database name
* Email user admin and email for send or system mail must be different, Email will work only with php-mail module enabled.
* If any errors occurs, go back and check the data entered.
* On valid data the script will create and populate the database plus write a configuration file.

Note that the installer performs basic configuration required to get osTicket up and running. 
Further configuration is required, post-install, to make the system fully functional. 

**Config file permission**: Change permission of ost-config.php to remove write access as shown below.

`chmod 0644 include/ost-config.php`

Now with last command, your osTicket installation has been completed successfully. 
Your next step is to fully configure your new support ticket system by the web interface.
